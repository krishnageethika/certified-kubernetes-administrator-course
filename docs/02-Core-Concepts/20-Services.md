# Kubernetes Services
  - Take me to [Video Tutorial](https://kodekloud.com/topic/services-3/)
  
In this section we will take a look at **`services`** in kubernetes

## Services
- Kubernetes Services enables communication between various components within and outside of the application.

#### Let's look at some other aspects of networking

## External Communication

- How do we as an **`external user`** access the **`web page`**?

  - From the node (Able to reach the application as expected)
  
    ![srv2](../../images/srv2.PNG)
    
  - From outside world (This should be our expectation, without something in the middle it will not reach the application)
  
    ![srv3](../../images/srv3.PNG)

   - So we need something in the middle to help us map requests to the node from our laptop. Through the node, to the pod running the web container. This is where k8's Service comes into play. The K8's service is an object just like pods, replica sets, deployments.
   - One of its usecase is to listen to the port on the node and forward request on that port to a port on the pod running the web application. Nodeport: because the service listens to a port on the node and forward requests to the pod.
    
 ## Service Types
 
 #### There are 3 types of service types in kubernetes
 
   ![srv-types](../../images/srv-types.PNG)
 
 1. NodePort
    - Where the service makes an internal port accessible on a port on the NODE.
      ```
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Service
      metadata:
       name: myapp-service
      spec:
       types: NodePort
       ports:
       - targetPort: 80
         port: 80
         nodePort: 30008
      ```
     ![srvnp](../../images/srvnp.PNG)
      
      #### To connect the service to the pod
      ```
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Service
      metadata:
       name: myapp-service
      spec:
       type: NodePort
       ports:
       - targetPort: 80
         port: 80
         nodePort: 30008
       selector:
         app: myapp
         type: front-end
       ```

    ![srvnp1](../../images/srvnp1.PNG)
      
      #### To create the service
      ```
      $ kubectl create -f service-definition.yaml
      ```
      
      #### To list the services
      ```
      $ kubectl get services
      ```
      
      #### To access the application from CLI instead of web browser
      ```
      $ curl http://192.168.1.2:30008
      ```
      
      ![srvnp2](../../images/srvnp2.PNG)

      #### A service with multiple pods(To balance load accross three nodes it uses random algorithm)

      ![srvnp3](../../images/srvnp3.PNG)
      
      #### When Pods are distributed across multiple nodes
     
      ![srvnp4](../../images/srvnp4.PNG)

     - When we create a service, without us having to do any additional configuration k8's automatically creates a service that spans across all the nodes in the cluster and maps the target port to the same node port on all the nodes in the cluster. This way you can access the application using the IP of any node in the cluster and using the same port number which in this case is 30008.  
            
 1. ClusterIP
    - In this case the service creates a **`Virtual IP`** inside the cluster to enable communication between different services such as a set of frontend servers to a set of backend servers.
    
 1. LoadBalancer
    - Where the service provisions a **`loadbalancer`** for our application in supported cloud providers.
